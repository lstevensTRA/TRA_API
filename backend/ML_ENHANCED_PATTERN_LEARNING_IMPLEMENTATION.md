## Confidence Scoring Algorithm

The confidence scoring system combines multiple factors:

1. **Pattern Performance (40%)**
   - Historical success rate of the pattern
   - Number of successful vs failed extractions

2. **Pattern Complexity (20%)**
   - Simpler patterns get higher confidence
   - Regex length and complexity analysis

3. **Value Validation (20%)**
   - Field type validation (numeric, date, text)
   - Format validation based on field type

4. **Context Similarity (20%)**
   - TF-IDF similarity with historical successful extractions
   - Context window analysis around extraction

## Pattern Suggestion Generation

When a pattern fails to extract correctly, the system generates alternative patterns:

1. **Value-based Patterns**
   - Direct value matching with flexible spacing
   - Common prefix/suffix patterns

2. **Context-based Patterns**
   - Surrounding text analysis
   - Position-based pattern generation

3. **Hybrid Patterns**
   - Combination of value and context patterns
   - Adaptive pattern complexity

## Frontend Integration

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage
- Pattern performance data stored in memory (can be moved to database)
- ML models loaded once at startup
- Context similarity calculations optimized with TF-IDF
